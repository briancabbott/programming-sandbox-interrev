# programming-sandbox-interrev
Language Rev for a variety of platforms, interview angle orientation Sandbox Repo. 

C is the source. The rest are currently pointers to remember to come back to them.

The motivation for the plethora is Sapir-Whorf:
The languages known by the mind, forms the totality of the landscape to which it
can traverse. The totality of internal experiences, as well as then, experiences
that can be projected outwardly - communicated in some form or, found and understood
by experiences had by the observer.  

The modern term it looks like is Linguistic Relativity:

Without understanding that perception, this repository might appear to be an instance
within insanity. I hope, that it is not, but one never knows.  


The intention or layout of this repository has taken on a differant shape after talking 
with several orginizational architects, leads, and recruiters. The macro-shape is: 

-Code
-Cloud
-Data
-DevOps
-MachLearn
-WebClient
-Web-Fullstack

Generally these seem to be major vectors of interest within the industry ATM (March, 2018). 
I will capture notes and thoughts for each industry pillar in corresponding sections below.
They are listed non-alphabetical but, in order of perceived importance within the industry
at the moment.

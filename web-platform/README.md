This directory is for things like the new W3C Standards that, in my opinion, are working to 
create a rich full-stack programming platform a-top the web. That is, things like
web-workers, location, file-system access -- Things that normally would have had
to have been done in back-end platform code (i.e. .NET, J2EE, python, etc) are now
accessible via a pure web stack (i.e. client-side javascript). 

How then is this differant from the web-client directory -- This location is to serve
as a place to look at and explore these technologies genericall where, web-client
project focuses on using specific libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, 
jQuery, etc.

One requirement for entries here is that there is a corresponding standard and then, 
we play with the techniques and technologies in the standard using the languages and 
libraries ccaptured by or, most closely represented by the standard.
